# Python_and_Data_Science
#**This is my journey to Data Science and Data Analysis using Python as the Key Programming Language**
I will be using this Repo to learn python and data science , and also tracker my progress in the two fields.
Since I have learned Python for a while now. I will commit a few basics in python and then commit major learning on most useful python libraries when it comes to Data Science.
The Basics of Python I will go through to remind and get a grip on are:
       1. Introduction of how to set up your programming environment through Anaconda.
       2. Working with Jupyter notebook. 
       3. Cover the basics of variables, data types, and basic operations in Python.
       4. Cover the main functionality of lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries in Python.
       5. Cover condition statements, logic statements (if, else, and elif), loops (for and while), and functions.
       6. Cover OOP, defining a class, adding attributes, adding methods, and class inheritance in Python
       
Libraries to dig into are:
       1. Numpy -- very useful when working with Matrix and Arrays of data.
                -- it is the array processing package.
                -- used in numerical computation and vectorization
                -- it forms base for other libraries including Pandas and Scikit
               * **What to cover:** the basics of Numpy Arrays, mathematical operations within 
                the package and how to interact with the Random Number functionality
       2. Pandas -- major needed when working with series of data,excel sheets and dataframes.
                 -- Used for data analysis and cleaning
                 * **What to Cover:** how to create a Pandas Series and a Pandas DataFrame, 
                 how to access information from this data structure and 
                 then what operations can we perform when the data is in the structure.
       3. Matplotlib -- used for visualizationa and graphical analysis of data
                     -- it is the plotting library in python
                     * **What to Cover:** how to construct a basic plot,
                     plotting multiple sets of information on the same graph and
                     then plotting information across multiple axes.
       4. Any other python library to be need in the Journey
 Learn more of SQL.
 After I will learn how to apply Python in Data Science and carrying out data create, manipulation and analysis with python.   
** Data Science with Python:** Covering the four main categories of Machine Learning models:
                                     1. Regression,
                                     2. Classification, 
                                     3. Clustering, and 
                                     4. Dimensionality Reduction through several of the most commonly used algorithms applied on different datasets and examples.

**The purpose of this is to cover all of the basics that any Data Scientist would need on their journey and Dive Deep into becoming a Data Scientist**

**SO HELP ME GOD!!**
