# Python_and_Data_Science
#This is my journey to Data Science and Data Analysis using Python as the Key Programming Language
I will be using this Repo to learn python and data science , and also tracker my progress in the two fields.
Since I have learned Python for a while now. I will commit a few basics in python and then commit major learning on most useful python libraries when it comes to Data Science.
The Basics of Python I will go through to remind and get a grip on are:
       1. Introduction of how to set up your programming environment through Anaconda.
       2. Working with Jupyter notebook. 
       3. Cover the basics of variables, data types, and basic operations in Python.
       
Libraries to dig into are:
       1. Numpy -- very useful when working with Matrix and Arrays of data.
                -- it is the array processing package.
                -- used in numerical computation and vectorization
                -- it forms base for other libraries including Pandas and Scikit
       2. Pandas -- major needed when working with series of data,excel sheets and dataframes.
                 -- Used for data analysis and cleaning
       3. Matplotlib -- used for visualizationa and graphical analysis of data
                     -- it is the plotting library in python
       4. Any other python library to be need in the Journey
